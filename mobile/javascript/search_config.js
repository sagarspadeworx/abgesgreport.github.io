ABG LIFE SAVING RULES            Our people often work in demanding roles and extreme conditions across varied geographies. They encounter diverse set of hazards           depending on the operational environment of the businesses. The GSC, together with business teams, analysed the historical data           within ABG to  nd common set of rules to prevent serious injuries and built the ABG Life Saving Rules.           The ten ABG Life Saving Rules equip all stakeholders with a set of simple safety rules that are common to all businesses.

In such a                                               scenario, circularity makes perfect sense for all stakeholders involved. When we            tonnes of waste reused,                 recycled or utilised          regenerate a resource instead of extracting and processing it, we are not only                 by ABG businesses             decreasing the overall environmental footprint but also the costs involved in it.                                                At Aditya Birla Group, we understand                                               the importance of circularity and the                                               opportunity it presents.                   18.36%                      Be it using alternative materials to replace virgin raw materials or increasing the share                   recycled material           of renewable sources in the energy mix, ABG businesses have been at the forefront of                used for production                    by UltraTech out           circularity in the last few years. The actions have been within the ABG businesses,                of total raw material          thereby creating smaller loops across the geographies of our operations. This has led                              in FY21          to a change in philosophy in the way we procure raw materials as well as the way we                                               manage wastes generated from our operations.

The fundamental philosophy is to identify alternative uses for wastes and alternatives to replace virgin nature based raw         materials.         This shift includes identifying processes, digital technologies and platforms that can assist in enabling this transition. We have         successfully established cross business utilisation of some of the waste generated such as waste gypsum, pond ash,  y ash, red         mud, copper slag which is successfully substituting natural raw materials used in the manufacturing process.

Our long-term focus is on GHG emissions capture, investment in renewable energy projects, use of hydrogen and           mainstreaming carbon pricing tool to drive eﬃciencies and carbon performance across businesses.             1. USE OF RENEWABLE AND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES           1. Using renewable energy sources like solar and wind along with energy storage  |  2. Adopting low carbon fuels like natural gas           and hydrogen  |  3. Leveraging biomass-based fuels like agricultural residues  |  4. Utilising waste materials with calori c value like           municipal waste, organic industrial solid wastes, among others.           Ÿ ABG businesses have made early strides in using renewable and alternative energy sources.           Ÿ Hindalco has installed renewable energy capacity of 49 MW and targeting to achieve 100 MW by FY23.            Ÿ UltraTech targets to meet 100 per cent of its electricity requirement through renewable sources by 2050. It has set a target to scale            up its green energy mix to 34% of its total electrical power requirement by 2024, from the current levels of 13%.  In the last two            years, the company has enhanced its contracted renewable energy capacity by 2.5 times. In October 2021, UltraTech signed a non-            binding MoU with Punjab Renewable Energy Systems Pvt. Ltd (PRESPL) under which PRESPL will execute biomass-based projects            at three of UltraTech’s units - cumulatively, estimated to generate annual carbon savings of over 150 thousand tonnes of CO .                                                                                                            2           Ÿ The share of renewable energy in total energy mix of ABFRL, Birla Cellulose, Textiles and Chemicals business are            49%, 34%, 11.3% and 1.23% respectively.                   INVESTING FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE  |  Aditya Birla Renewables                 The need for clean energy and the urgent need to step up generation to                mitigate the climate change risks proved the setting for the Aditya Birla                Group's foray into the renewable energy sector in 2011. Initially, the                renewable business was set up as part of the Essel Mining \& Industries Ltd.,                but later a separate company – Aditya Birla Renewables Ltd. – was formed to                give shape to the Group's vision for the sector. Today, the business has 575                MW operational plants and 250 MW project pipeline.              2. ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION           This primarily involves reducing the quantity of energy used in our operations and conserve/recover energy through activities like           recovering waste heat, waste gases with calori c value, among others. Towards this, UltraTech has installed Waste Heat Recovery           System (WHRS) of 125 MW capacity, and is targeting to achieve 302 MW by FY24. Similarly, on energy productivity, UltraTech joined           EP100 in 2018 and committed to double its energy productivity from the base year of 2010 to the target year of 2035. It surpassed           this goal in 2020, well ahead of its target timeline.                   USING WASTE HEAT TO POWER OPERATIONS  |  UltraTech Cement Ltd., Kotputli, India                The Kotputli Cement Works Unit of UltraTech Cement Ltd. (UTCL) operates a dedicated single line cement plant having a                10,000 TPD clinker capacity at Kotputli, Rajasthan. While the plant was optimised for the cement burning process, there were                still signi cant heat losses, mainly due to the heat released along with waste gases. The heat balance report of a kiln plant                revealed that pre-heater waste gases and cooler exhaust air accounted for more than 35.5% of heat loss. The productive                capture of this waste heat oﬀered a signi cant opportunity to improve energy eﬃciency and reduce emissions.                A waste heat recovery-based power plant was installed at the facility. The heat values of pre-heater exhaust gases and               clinker cooler exhaust gases were utilised in the waste heat recovery boilers to generate steam. The superheated steam was               then introduced to the steam-driven turbine generator to produce power which in turn was utilised for the cement plant               operations. Reduction in usage of grid and/or captive thermal power plant as it was substituted with green power from               Waste Heat Recovery System led to both energy savings as well as reduction in GHG emissions.                                                                60","3.

This approach has been enshrined in ABG's Water Stewardship Policy and         associated Water Risk Management Standard. The Policy aims at protection and conservation of water resources through excellent         water management practices and governance systems. The Policy is implemented by setting targets and roadmaps across ABG         sites. The actions include assessing water risks, developing strategies and then implementing the mitigation measures.         Inside the plant, businesses have been undertaking initiatives such as water usage monitoring and audits; measures to reduce,         reuse, and recycle wastewater; plan for water emergencies; water harvesting and product innovation. These water management         initiatives are aimed towards optimising the use of freshwater, maximising its reuse and recycle, and deploying state-of-the-art         wastewater treatment options. With the changes in rainfall patterns across our site locations, we have initiated the process of         reviewing and revising the storm water management plans at our locations. Outside the plant boundary, sites again monitor water         quality and practice rainwater harvesting and arti cial aquifer recharge methods through collaborative projects at watershed level.

Over time, our approach to wastewater management has moved from 'end of pipe'           to 'source segregation and treatment' to maximise reuse and recycle.           Most of the ABG businesses are also reporting their water performance publicly in accordance with the GRI standards. In FY21, the           Group businesses have harvested a total of 70 million m  water (including inside and outside plant boundary). Businesses are           replacing their freshwater consumption with recycled water in their operational activities wherever feasible. The use of recycled           water is expected to increase as many of the business sites are implementing ZLD systems.              WATER MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES            Moving from a conventional conservation practice to implementing innovative solutions, ABG businesses are progressing well on           their water stewardship journey. We understand that to be water resilient we not only need to regenerate water but holistically look           towards securing water for all and upgrade to accommodate the future requirements of business and community.  This can be           demonstrated from some of the select best practices presented below:              UTILISING TSE WATER AND RECHARGING GROUND WELLS           Star Cement Co L.L.C, Ras al Khaimah, UAE           Ras al Khaiman (RAK) is one of the 7           emirates that make up the United Arab           Emirate. It is characterised by a desert           climate with hot and arid summers and           scant rainfall in winters. With the           increased productivity at the Star           Cement plant at RAK, there was           increase in water consumption and to           purchase water from UTICO - one of the           largest utility providers, was not           economically viable.            In search of an alternative solution, the           team at Star Cements got in touch with           RAKWA (a Government agency) to           explore the possibility of using Treated           Sewage Eﬄuent (TSE) water for process           requirement.  The team tested and           shortlisted TSE water from a plant           situated 33 km away from its base of           operation and negotiations were done           to transport adequate water to replace           the freshwater consumption, at least           partially.            The plant is taking an average of           275 m3 TSE water per day - water that           would have otherwise gone into the           sea. Additionally, to solve the problem           of groundwater wells going defunct,           arrangement were made for the           recharging of the well water bed by           pumping of the accumulated rain water           from the various area of the plant.           Post rehabilitation work, the plant           has achieved an average output of           180-200m3/Day from these wells.                                                                    68","REDUCING FRESHWATER USE THROUGH REUSE         Hindalco, Belagavi, Karnataka         Hindalco's world-class aluminium         re nery at Belagavi, Karnataka relied         solely on water supply from the local         municipal corporation to meet its water         demand for both process and domestic         use. The average water consumption at         the unit was in the range of 110 million         litres per month. The only other source         of water was via rainwater harvesting in         the catchment area. This dependence on         the water was identi ed as a key         business risk. With freshwater becoming         dearer, a price hike too was anticipated.                                               40%                         INR 24         To reduce freshwater consumption, a         dedicated team at the unit implemented   reduction in freshwater   million         an innovative project to send the     intake bringing it down to   cost saving         recycled and ETP-treated eﬄuents back   60-65 million litres per month  per annum         into the re nery process, thereby         promoting zero liquid discharge. A         dedicated freshwater line was installed   The initiative resulted in a reduction of freshwater intake by approximately 40%         to meet the freshwater requirement of   bringing it down to 60-65 million litre per month, resulting in a corresponding cost         the  lter press.                    saving of INR 24 million per annum.

First         and foremost being the development of our Group-wide Biodiversity Policy, Technical         Standard and Guidance Notes. These are geared to help us achieve our target of         managing biodiversity based on a No Net Loss (NNL) approach. NNL calls for potential         negative biodiversity impacts caused by projects to be balanced by applying a         recognised mitigation hierarchy involving avoidance, minimisation, rehabilitation/         restoration and oﬀsetting the residual impact. This target is aligned with provisions of         the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).           APPROACH AND INITIATIVES         The ABG biodiversity standard is built on a habitat-based approach and includes criteria whose applications allow ABG businesses         to determine the overall nature of their operational impacts, identify speci c sources of impact relative to sensitive receptors, and         prioritise their management actions.

The Annual Sustainability Conference hosted by Aditya Birla Group Sustainability Cell (AB GSC) and attended by senior               managers from the Group Businesses, industry experts and leading minds from around the world, is designed to serve two               core purposes:                  Ÿ Develop the leadership cadre to steer businesses to 2030, 2050 and beyond                 Ÿ Help ABG businesses evaluate risks and opportunities, and understand external macro-trends                In the  rst three conferences (2015 to 2017), we made a conscious eﬀort to think beyond the outdated 'do sustainability'               triple bottom line approach. These conferences focussed on megatrends that aﬀect businesses in the medium to long-term               and scenarios that businesses are likely to face in the future. In the 2018 and 2019 editions, we shifted focus towards the               necessary strategies required to transform existing businesses into those that will still be sustainable in 2030 and 2050.               The 6th edition of the ABG Sustain-ability Conference with the theme 'ESG Road to Resilience' was held from 28-30               September 2021. The Conference provided actionable insights and scalable solutions to help ABG businesses on their path               to greater sustain-ability. We also explored how ABG companies can more eﬀectively mainstream ESG in executive and               operational decision-making. The three-day transformative Group level virtual conference was designed through an               extensive collaborative approach with six ABMCPL Group Functions and ABG Business-led Working Groups.                  Day 1 had the theme of 'Inspire' and provided the 'Big Picture' through common plenary sessions comprising Chairman's                 address, ABG leadership remarks on ESGbility, keynote conversation, CEO panel, and a  reside chat                 Day 2 with the theme 'Interact' highlighted the 'Big Push' built around issues to be tackled, i.e. ABG's four material ESG                 topics: Decarbonisation, Circularity, Water and Wastewater management, and Safety/Zero Harm, running in parallel tracks                 across four dimensions: 1) Centrestage issue 2) Plant-level (design \& operation stage) interventions 3) Value chain                 management and 4) External and internal collaborations                 Day 3 called 'Innovate' aimed to usher in the 'Big Pursuit' across topics and explored the role of innovative processes and                 digital solutions that ABG could adapt to stay ahead of the curve                                 The Sustainability Conference 2021 was attended by               almost 3,000 delegates spread across three days.                                                                   77","SUSTAIN-ABILITY CONFERENCE - A FEW GLIMPSES                DAY 1             INSPIRE                                      DAY 2             INTERACT                                       DAY 3             INNOVATE                                                                                                           ...And many more...","Aditya Birla Centre, S.
